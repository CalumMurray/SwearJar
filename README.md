SwearJar
========

SwearJar App developed for Yahoo!'s HackU event.  The app detects how many times a user swears (or says user-defined word set) during phone calls and automatically pays a proportional amount to charity.

Sister repository Swear Jar Server (https://github.com/CalumMurray/SwearJarServer.git) is a server to perform server-side file transcoding etc.
